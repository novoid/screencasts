A brief demo file to test GIF performance on Github:

First, we're adding date- and time-stamps to a set of files:

file:date2name.gif

We then add more information to the file names:

file:appendfilename.gif

Adding keywords or tags to file names:

file:filetags_tagging.gif

You end up with a set of files. To retrieve specific files, you may use filter mechanism by tags:

file:filetags_tag_filter.gif

A more elaborated feature for file retrieval based on tags are my TagTrees:

file:filetags_TagTrees.gif

If you find those tag filter or TagTrees handy, you will be happy about these features that allow you changing tags within those temporary views:
